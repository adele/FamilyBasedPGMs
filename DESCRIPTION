Title: Methods for Learning Genetic and Environmental Graphical Models from Family Data
Version: 1.0
Author: Adèle Helena Ribeiro
Maintainer: Adèle Helena Ribeiro <adele@ime.usp.br>
Description: This package provides methods for learning, from observational Gaussian family data 
  (i.e., Gaussian data clusterized in families), undirected and directed acyclic PGMs describing linear 
  relationships among multiple phenotypes and a decomposition of the learned PGM into unconfounded genetic 
  and environmental PGMs. 
  In these cases, partial correlation tests based on univariate polygenic linear mixed models 
  are used as a separation oracles that answer whether a conditional independence relation holds or not
  in the total, genetic, and environmental components. The method used for causal structure learning 
  (learning of the structure of directed acyclic PGMs) is based on the IC/PC algorithm.
